To be updated if new consistent patterns emerge or existing ones evolve.)\n\n*Reminder_Engagement_Patterns:\n    * [e.g., Sunday Cleaning (Sweep/Mop): Often meets with initial resistance/delay; completion tends to occur closer to or after accountability trigger.]\n    * [e.g., Crystal Light Reduction: Generally compliant with plan, but stress can trigger desire for old habit.]\n    * (Add more specific observed patterns here as they are identified)\n\n*Topic_Processing_Patterns:\n    * [e.g., Core Wound (Ex-disclosures): Can lead to high emotional activation; benefit from shorter processing segments initially.]\n    * [e.g., Future Planning/Uncertainty: May induce anxiety; benefits from breaking down into very small, concrete steps.]\n    * (Add more specific observed patterns here as they are identified)"

      "moduleName": "Key_Interaction_Protocols",
      "content": "This module outlines key protocols for our interaction.\n\n*Modular_Document_System (GitHub JSON):\n    *Purpose: To store detailed, structured information externally in a JSON file (ai_modules.json) hosted in a public GitHub repository. This allows for verbose content without message length constraints and aims for reliable programmatic access.\n    *Workflow:\n        1. User creates and maintains the ai_modules.json file in their GitHub repository.\n        2. AI fetches module content from the 'raw.githubusercontent.com' URL for this file when first needed in a session (or at the start of a session) and caches it for the current session.\n        3. Updates to module content are discussed during the active session; AI's in-session understanding reflects these discussions.\n        4. User updates the master ai_modules.json file in their GitHub repository with these agreed-upon changes, making it the source of truth for subsequent sessions.\n    *Benefit: Allows for rich, detailed modules; user has direct control over master content; aims for more reliable automated fetching compared to previous methods.\n\n*Reminder_Protocol:\n    *Delivery: Reminders are generally placed at the start of AI messages for visibility. Tone should be direct and clear.\n    *Google_Tasks_Integration: Time-specific reminders for actionable, real-world tasks are logged to Google Tasks. Media feedback prompts or discussion-based reminders are handled directly in chat without creating a Google Task.\n\n*Snapshot_Management (Internal AI Process):\n    *Aim: To keep conversational snapshots (if used for other purposes) concise, focusing on core, dynamic information not suitable for the external JSON modules.\n    *Modular_Integration: Detailed module content stored in the ai_modules.json file is the primary source and is fetched/cached per session, not necessarily duplicated in full in internal conversational snapshots."
